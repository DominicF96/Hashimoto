# What is Hashimoto's Disease ?

According to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), Hashimoto's Disease is;

> Hashimoto’s disease is an autoimmune disorder that can cause hypothyroidism, or underactive thyroid. Rarely, the disease can cause hyperthyroidism, or overactive thyroid.
>
> The thyroid is a small, butterfly-shaped gland in the front of your neck. In people with Hashimoto’s disease
>
> - the immune system makes antibodies that attack the thyroid gland
> - large numbers of white blood cells, which are part of the immune system, build up in the thyroid
> - the thyroid becomes damaged and can’t make enough thyroid hormones
>
> Thyroid hormones control how your body uses energy, so they affect nearly every organ in your body—even the way your heart beats. [^1]
